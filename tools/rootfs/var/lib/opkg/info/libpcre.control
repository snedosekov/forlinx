Package: libpcre
Version: 8.31-r0
Description: libpcre version 8.31-r0
 Perl-compatible regular expression library. PCRE has its own native API,
 but a set of 'wrapper' functions that are based on the POSIX API are also
 supplied in the library libpcreposix. Note that this just provides a
 POSIX calling interface to PCRE; the regular expressions themselves still
 follow Perl syntax and semantics. The header file for the POSIX-style
 functions is called pcreposix.h.
